Idempotent Pipelines are critical. 
Idempotent pipelines should give same numbers any time, any day 
SCD : dimensions that change over a period of time. 
Types of SCD: 0,1,2,3
Type 0 : dimensions that do not change (ex- birth date)
Type 1 : pipelines can never be idempotent . comes with latest value 
probably ok for OLTP but not preferred for Analytical purposes. 
TYPE 2: purely idempotent. dimensions with a start date and a end date. 
Type 3: dimensions with a original value and a current value. partially idempotent. 

Load the entire history in one query, incrementally load the data 
player_seasons ---> players ----> players_scd
